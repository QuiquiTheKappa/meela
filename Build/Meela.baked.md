# Grammar

## Nouns


For plural, the syable /gru/ is attached to the noun. For the word ilu (tree), the plural would be ilugru (trees). 
Sometimes, a a word can change its meaning depending on context.
Forst means ilushu, meaning "many trees together".

iluu -> iluugru (many trees)
iluu -> iluushu (many trees together | forest)

The sylable -shu binds objects together in a more intimate, binding way.
The same goes for pronouns.

| ----- | ------- | -------------- |
| ee    | I       |                |
| eegru | us      | as individuals |
| eeshu | us      | as tribe       |

When specific objects are meant, you attach a -va

| Meela   | English   |
| ------- | --------- |

To negate a word, a -jo is attached before the word. 
When the verb begins with a vocal, instead of -jo, -jon is attached.

| ----------- | ------- | --------------- |
| happy       | -sha    | aaolasha        |
| sad         | -shu    | aaolashu        |
| euphoric    | -shasah | aaolashasha     |
| sorrowed    | -gru    | aaolagru        |

| melancholic | -druu   | aaoladruu       |
| fear        | -hu     | aaolahu         |

They can be mixed.

## Adjectives

All verbs end with either a or u but never with -la or -lu.

| Meela   | English   |
| ------- | --------- |
| dreea   | bright    |
| leeiluu | beautiful |
| asheea  | warm      |

Adjectives are negated similar to verbs.

| Positive | Negative  | English   |
| -------- | --------- | --------- |
| dreea    | jodreea   | bright    |
| leeiluu  | joleeiluu | beautiful |
| ashea    | jonashea  | warm      |

To describe the properties of a specifc object, the adjective comes before the noun.
A -lu is used to connect the adjective to the noun.

| Meela                        | English                      |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ugru lu iluu                 | the tree that is big         |
| dreea lu beegu lleeiluu eela | the bright fire is beautiful |


## Sentences

The order for A is B sentences is `[Object][Subject][Verb]`. 
The verb "to be" can be omitted.

| Meela               | English (Meela Grammar) | English             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| hushu dreea eela    | light bright is         | light is bright     |
| hushu dreea joneela | light bright not is     | light is not bright |

Base structure for a sentence is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). 
The subject marker (va) comes directly after the subject. 
If describing an object, the adjective comes after the subject and before the verb.

`[Subject][Marker][Adjective][Verb]`

| Meela                          | English (Meela Grammar) | English                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| iluu va leiilu eela            | this tree is beautiful  | tree this beautiful be    |
| jouushudroo va jondreea eelama | this dream was dark     | dream this not-bright was |

If a subject or object is specified using an adjective, it comes before the subject or object.

`[Adjective][Subject][Marker][Adjective][Verb]`

| Meela                    | English (Meela Grammar)    | English                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| leiilu iluu va ugru eela | beautiful tree this big is | this beautiful tree is big |

Imperatives are rarely used in Meela as it is impolite to order someone to so something.
An order is given by repeating the verb in its base form. 
Usually, a polite „hu“ is added.
Omitting the hu usually is reserved for emergencies. 

| Meela          | English | Formally |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Buula buula    | Go!     | Impolite |
| Buula buula hu | Go!     | Polite   |
It’s important to notice the „hu“ is similar to the emotional syllable for fear. 
This is attributes to fauns mostly using the imperative when they are scared to coordinate the tribe.
