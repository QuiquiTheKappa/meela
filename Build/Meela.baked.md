For plural, the syable /gru/ is attached to the noun. For the word ilu (tree), the plural would be ilugru (trees). 
Sometimes, a a word can change its meaning depending on context.

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| ugru lu iluu                 | the tree that is big         |
| dreea lu beegu lleeiluu eela | the bright fire is beautiful |


## Sentences

### Simple Descriptions

The order for A is B sentences is `[Object][Subject][Verb]`. 
The verb "to be" can be omitted.

| Meela               | English (Meela Grammar) | English             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| hushu dreea eela    | light bright is         | light is bright     |
| hushu dreea joneela | light bright not is     | light is not bright |


### Marking Subjects

Base structure for a sentence is Subject-Object-Verb (SOV). 
The subject marker (va) comes directly after the subject. 
If describing an object, the adjective comes after the subject and before the verb.

`[Subject][Marker][Adjective][Verb]`

| Meela                          | English (Meela Grammar) | English                   |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| iluu va leiilu eela            | this tree is beautiful  | tree this beautiful be    |
| jouushudroo va jondreea eelama | this dream was dark     | dream this not-bright was |

If a subject or object is specified using an adjective, it comes before the subject or object.

`[Adjective][Subject][Marker][Adjective][Verb]`

| Meela                    | English (Meela Grammar)    | English                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| leiilu iluu va ugru eela | beautiful tree this big is | this beautiful tree is big |


### Posession

To mark possession, the possession marker *vashuu* is used.

| Meela                     | English           | English (Meela Word Order)          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| iluu va ee vashuu eela    | This is my tree   | tree this I (possession marker) is  |
| drooiidrala va eeshu eela | this is our tribe | tribe this we (posession marker) is |


### Imperative

Imperatives are rarely used in Meela as it is impolite to order someone to so something.
An order is given by repeating the verb in its base form. 
Usually, a polite „hu“ is added.
Omitting the hu usually is reserved for emergencies. 

| Meela          | English | Formally |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Buula buula    | Go!     | Impolite |
| Buula buula hu | Go!     | Polite   |
It’s important to notice the „hu“ is similar to the emotional syllable for fear. 
This is attributes to fauns mostly using the imperative when they are scared to coordinate the tribe.
