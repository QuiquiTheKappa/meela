Imperatives are rarely used in Meela as it is impolite to order someone to so something.
An order is given by repeating the verb in its base form. 
Usually, a polite „hu“ is added.
Omitting the hu usually is reserved for emergencies. 

| Meela          | English | Formally |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- |
| Buula buula    | Go!     | Impolite |
| Buula buula hu | Go!     | Polite   |
It’s important to notice the „hu“ is similar to the emotional syllable for fear. 
This is attributes to fauns mostly using the imperative when they are scared to coordinate the tribe.
