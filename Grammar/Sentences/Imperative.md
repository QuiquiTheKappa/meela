Imperatives are rarely used in Meela as it is impolite to order someone to so something.
An order is given by repeating the verb in its base form. 
Usually, a polite „hu“ is added.
Omitting the hu usually is reserved for emergencies.

| <span style="font-family: Meela; font-size: 32px">buula buula</span>   | Buula buula   | Go!     | Impolite |
| <span style="font-family: Meela; font-size: 32px">buula buulahu</span> | Buula buulahu | Go!     | Polite   |
It’s important to notice the „hu“ is similar to the emotional syllable for fear. 
This is attributes to fauns mostly using the imperative when they are scared to coordinate the tribe.
