For plural, the syable /gru/ is attached to the noun. For the word ilu (tree), the plural would be ilugru (trees). 
Sometimes, a a word can change its meaning depending on context.
Forst means ilushu, meaning "many trees together".

iluu -> iluugru (many trees)
iluu -> iluushu (many trees together | forest)

The sylable -shu binds objects together in a more intimate, binding way.
The same goes for pronouns.
